# Tutorial for Stanford Dependency & Constituency Parsing 

# You need the followng:
    > stanford-parser-full-2018-10-17/stanford-parser.jar

    > stanford-postagger-full-2018-10-16/stanford-postagger.jar 

    > stanford-english-corenlp-2018-10-05-models.jar 

    > These packages can be downloaded from https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/

# What it is ?

    > The driver program can be used to get the dependency and constituency tree of
      the text in some input file.

   > Example text files are given in 'input' folder which is nothing but the sick
     data (https://wiki.cimec.unitn.it/tiki-index.php?page=CLIC) 
 
   > The program (driver.py) can be easily modified to parse any text (english)
